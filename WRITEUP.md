For deploying the CMS app, both Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and Azure App Service present viable options, each with distinct trade-offs across cost, scalability, availability, and workflow. In terms of cost, VMs typically incur higher expenses due to OS licensing, manual scaling, and the need to maintain always-on resources, whereas App Service is more cost-effective for web applications thanks to its consumption-based pricing and managed infrastructure. When it comes to scalability, scaling a VM requires setting up VM Scale Sets and manual configuration, while App Service supports easy horizontal scaling through built-in autoscaling features with minimal effort. Regarding availability, VMs require additional setup such as Load Balancers and Availability Sets or Zones to ensure redundancy and uptime, while App Service provides high availability and automatic failover out-of-the-box. For workflow, VMs offer full control over the server environment, which may be necessary for custom setups, but they require more effort to configure CI/CD pipelines and system management. In contrast, App Service provides a simplified deployment workflow with native integration to GitHub, Azure DevOps, and deployment slots, making it more efficient for continuous deployment and updates.

Considering all these factors, Azure App Service is the more appropriate solution for deploying the CMS app. It is significantly easier to manage, scales automatically, ensures high availability with less overhead, and integrates seamlessly into modern development workflows. These benefits make it ideal for a CMS application, which is typically stateless and web-based, allowing the team to focus on building and delivering features without being burdened by infrastructure maintenance.
